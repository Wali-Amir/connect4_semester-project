# connect4_semester-project
# Description
This was my freshman year CS100 semester project. I decided to program Connect 4 in the C++ terminal, as it is a game I love playing with my mother. This is my first full-fledged project and my first upload to GitHub.  
My CS 100 course required creating a project from a list or selecting one of my choice. My teammate and I chose to create Connect 4. The project requirements entailed having varying levels of difficulty; thus, the code allows two different grid sizes. I also chose to have a one-player and a two-player mode. The one-player is a rudimentary randomiser, so it is extremely easy to win against. It was also necessary to have ways to save progress, which turned out to be the most challenging logic to implement. There are also leaderboard files that are local to your computer. 

# Gameplay

# Installation
Download the two .cpp files, the .h file (compulsory), and the .txt files (optional). Open the folder the files are located in, and in the terminal type the command: 
g++ connectN_main.cpp connectN_functions.cpp -o connectNgame; .\connectNgame

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my teammate, Shaharyar, for being with me on this project's journey. He helped in deciding which project to do, some features to add and was supportive in listening to my rants throughout this process. He also handled the non-programming aspects of the project and was vital in securing the final grade. I would also like to thank Muneeb, our project TA, who helped resolve some of the errors we were facing.

You can download this project to your computer and play the game as much as you want. It would actually make me happy to hear about someone doing that. You are welcome to make changes to the code and improve it where you believe it is applicable. I kindly request that you refrain from copying this project and using it as your submission in school or university. I would urge you to build a project from scratch because this was a very rewarding experience. Happy coding!
